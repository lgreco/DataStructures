## Input/output operations in linked lists

We'll use classes ``LinkedList`` and ``Node`` to implement two different ways for adding and removing data from a linked list.

### Last-in/first-out operations (LIFO)

In LIFO operations, data are added to the back of the linked list and removed from the front. The input method ``addLast`` is provided. It mirrors the way we added ``TrainStation`` objects to a ``TrainLine`` object.

To complete the LIFO operations, you must finish the method ``deleteFirst``.

### First-in/first-out operations (FIFO)

In FIFO operations, data are added and removed from the front of the list. To implement FIFO operations you need to finish the method ``addFirst``. For removals, you can use the method ``deleteFirst`` from the previous step.
