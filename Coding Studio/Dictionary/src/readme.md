## Building a dictionary

This project leads to the "discovery" of a data structure similar to arrays but with added flexibility and functionality. We start with a simple task: create a dictionary of all the words found in a file. The specifications for this task are:

* The file is stored on the web; its location is provided to us in the form of a link (URL). For example, we can look at the text from *[A Tale of Two Cities](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-0.txt),* or any other book that is available on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
* The file to process is a plain text file, not an HTML, or ePub, or PDF, etc.
* The dictionary must contain no duplicates. Each word must appear only once. For now it's ok to treat singular and plural forms as *different* words. E.g., dog/dogs are treated as different words, as do child/children, etc.
* Use a String array to store the words of the dictionary.
* No external classes may be used without Leo's approval.
* Follow the Programmer's Pact. (You can find it in module 1 of Sakai, as well as in this repository.)

You may use class BookToDictionary in this repository to build your code.
