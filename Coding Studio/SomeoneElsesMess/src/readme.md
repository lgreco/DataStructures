## Someone else's mess

You were just hired as the new developer for a construction company. The previous programmer, Enol Kusm left the company to join a circus. On your first day on the job, you find that Enol was not so good of a programmer as you have heard. Looking at the code left behind by Enol, you realize it's a mess. Suddenly, it all comes back to you: didn't you hear something about classes extended a class, and classes implementing interfaces, to make things more manageable? Can you apply your knowledge of inheritance using a superclass and an interface, to clean up after Enol Kusm's mess?
