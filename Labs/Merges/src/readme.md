# Lab for Thursday, June 23

Let's develop a method,called ``merge`` that:

* accept two integer arrays that are sorted in ascending order;
* merges them in an array that is also sorted in ascending order, and;
* returns the merged array.

This method may -- or may not -- require the use of other methods to perform certain tasks. If such methods are needed, we must justify them first.
