# Warm up exercises for COMP 271, Fall 2022

The course assumes that you have completed COMP 170 or equivalent course, and that you are taking or have taken COMP 163. At the very least, you need to be familiar with the following topics (numbers in parentheses are the corresponding chapters from the textbook; we are using the same textbook as COMP 170).

* How to use JSheel (2)
* Variables and literals (2)
* The for loop (2)
* The while loop (5)
* What are method parameters (2, 3)
* Methods that return values (3)
* If statements (4)
* Processing text (4)
* Assertions and program logic (5)
* Arrays (7)

As you are preparing for the fall term, please consider reviewing Chapters 2, 4, 5, and 7 of the textbook. Try every self-check problem at the end of these chapters. Then do the following programming projects. These will be your first homework assignment anyway. It will be due 8/30/22 (yes, we have homework due on the second day of classes!)

* Chapter 4: programming project 2 (day of the week). While you can accomplish everything in one method only (in main()), try building a program that has at least three methods, including main().
* Chapter 5: programming project 1 (pig latin). While you can accomplish everything in one method only (in main()), try building a program that has at least three methods, including main().
* Chapter 7: programming project 1 (add large positive numbers), but with the following twist: instead of using arrays, use two strings, one for each number. The numbers are positive only (ie, donâ€™t worry about representing negative numbers). While you can accomplish everything in one method only (in main()), try building a program that has at least two methods, including main().


These three programming projects will take some time. They are within your COMP 170 programming skills. You can solve them with static methods and without any external classes except for String. In fact you should not use any external classes (except for String and the System.out print commands).

To help you started with each programming project, consider the following tips and suggestions.

## Chapter 4, programming project 2

This is the most challenging of the three projects. Its premise is simple: if today is *Monday* what day will it be after 7 days? Monday again, right? After 14 day? Also Monday. After 701 days? It will be Tuesday. Because 701= 700+1. And 700 days from a Monday, it will be Monday, and plus one more day makes it Tuesday.

### Problem analysis

If we have a reference date for which we know the day it falls on, we can find what day falls any date after it. For example, if our reference date is August 1, 2022 and we know it falls on a Monday, what day is 8/17/22?

We find the difference between the two dates:

```text
(8/17/22) - (8/1/22) = 16 days = 14+2
```

We know that 8/1/22 is a Monday. Fourteen days after a Monday, it is also a Monday, so we are left with the `+2` that takes us two days after a Monday. It will be a Wednesday.

No matter how big the difference may be between the two dates, we only need to know how many days are left after the nearest multiple of 7. Monday plus 9 days is the same as Monday plus 2 days.

What we have here, really, is a modulo function: 

```text
Monday + 9 days = 
                  Monday + 9 % 7 days = 
                  Monday + 2 days
```

With that in mind, we can write the following solution:

```text
input: target date to find what day of week it falls
init: base date -- with known day of week

diff = days between reference date and target day
days after reference date = diff % 7
```

### Design considerations
The strategy above is simple, but we need to put it to code. And without using any assistance from Java utilities or date/time classes. To do so, we must answer the following questions:

* what's the simplest way to represent a date in a Java program? (We cannot use the Date, DateTime, or any other class, really, other than String).
* How to advance a date representation by one day? Here, we have to be careful and mont and year boundaries. For example, what is the date after July 31? Or December 31?
* How to compute the difference between two date representations? Remember that we have to take into consideration that some years have an extra day, some months have 30 days, others 31, and, a nasty one has 28 or 29 days.
* How to translate the result of the modulo operation to an actual day name?

## Chapter 5, programming project 1

_is-Thay is-ay a-ay elatively-ray easy-ay roblem-pay._ (This is a relatively easy problem).

### Problem analysis

The problem specifies how to replace the consonant *sounds* that a word begins with. It is important therefore, that we understand the difference between a consonant letter and a consonant sound.

### Design considerations

* How to tell is the beginning of a word is a vowel or a consonant *sound*?
* How to parse a sentence, word-by-word and translate each word to Pig Latin?

## Chapter 7, programming project 1

The textbook problem requires that we use arrays to represent integer numbers beyond Java's primary types `int` and `long`. But in this variation, we will be using strings to represent very large integer numbers. The largest integer value that Java can represent is `9223372036854775807` which is a `long` type. Even the smallest addition, like

```Java
9223372036854775807L + 1L
```

will return the wrong value (try this on Jshell for yourself). So, how can we add numbers that are greater than the largest `long` value that Java can represent? In this analysis we'll use small numbers, to keep the examples simple and brief.

### Problem analysis

How do we add numbers? We are doing additions all the time in our heads, almost automatically, without even slowing down to contemplate the steps we take. Ask anyone what is 99+1 equal to, and the immediate answer is 100.

To add these two numbers we line them up so that their least significant digits are on top of each other:

```text
  99
 + 1
```

And then we add pairs of equal significant digits, writing their sum to the corresponding position under the two numbers. But here's the problem: 9+1 produces a two-digit value, 10. So, we need to break this result into a sum digit and a carry digit:

```text
  99
 + 1
----
   0 <--- sum digit
  1  <--- carry digit
```

In reality, each addition of pairwise digits is an addition of three digits: the original pair and the carry from the previous pair's addition. For the first pair, the least significant one, the carry is set to 0. 

The addition of two single-digit numbers can be expressed as a pair of single digit numbers as well: a carry and a sum digit. The carry can be either 0 or 1. The sum digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

### Design considerations

* How to pull pair-wise digits from two strings of different lengths? For example, if we are adding `String a = "123"` and `String b = "9"`, the pairwise additions we need to perform are 3+9, 2+0, and 1+0; and that's without taking into account the carry.
* How to generate a carry and a sum digit from two single-digit numbers? For example 3+8 yields a carry of 1 and a sum of 2.
